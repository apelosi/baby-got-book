## BOOK STRUCTURE & FORMAT

### Physical Format
- **Page Count**: Always an odd number of pages (typically 11, 13 or 15 content pages)
- **Book Components**:
  - Front cover (page 1)
  - Inside front cover/title page (page 2)
  - Content pages (11, 13, or 15 pages)
  - Back cover (final page)
- **Format**: Square format, optimized for small hands
- **Page Layout**: Board book with thick, durable pages

### Scene Structure
- **Two-Page Spreads**: Scenes frequently span across two facing pages (left and right)
- **Spread Continuity**: When a scene spans multiple pages, use the SAME background color across all pages in that spread
- **Visual Flow**: Left-to-right reading flow is supported by character placement and action direction

---

## ILLUSTRATION STYLE

### CRITICAL: Character Consistency Requirements

**THIS IS ESSENTIAL - CHARACTER CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL PAGES IS MANDATORY**

#### Reference Image Usage
- **ALWAYS study and closely match reference images** when creating characters based on real people
- Reference images show the actual appearance of characters - skin tone, hair color, hair texture, facial features, body type
- Characters MUST maintain the EXACT SAME appearance across all pages in the book
- Only clothing, expressions, and poses may vary between pages

#### Character Consistency Rules
1. **Skin Tone**: Use the EXACT same skin tone for each character in every page
2. **Hair**: Maintain consistent hair color, length, texture, and style across all pages
3. **Facial Features**: Keep facial structure, eye shape, nose shape identical in every appearance
4. **Body Proportions**: Character height and build should be consistent throughout
5. **Level of Detail**: All characters should have the same amount of detail across all pages
6. **Distinctive Features**: Any distinguishing characteristics (glasses, freckles, etc.) must appear consistently

#### Using Reference Photos
- When reference photos are provided of real people, characters MUST match:
  - **Ethnicity and skin tone** as shown in photos
  - **Hair color and texture** as shown in photos
  - **Age-appropriate features** as shown in photos
  - **Overall appearance** as shown in photos
- Create a mental model of each character from the reference photos BEFORE starting any illustration
- If a character appears in multiple pages, use the SAME character design every time

### Text Overlay Space Requirements

**CRITICAL: EVERY PAGE MUST HAVE SPACE FOR TEXT**

#### Text Placement Guidelines
- **Reserve 20-30% of the page** for text overlay (typically top, bottom, or side)
- Text areas should be:
  - Solid background color with NO characters or objects
  - Clear of visual clutter
  - Positioned where text naturally fits (corners, edges, or center depending on composition)
- **Do NOT place characters or important objects in text areas**
- Text will be overlaid on the image, so keep text zones simple and unobstructed

#### Page Composition with Text in Mind
- Position main characters and action in 60-70% of the page
- Leave remaining 30-40% as clean background space for text
- Text areas can be:
  - Top third of page (characters at bottom)
  - Bottom third of page (characters at top)
  - Left or right side (characters on opposite side)
  - Split between top and bottom (characters in middle)

### Image Format Requirements

**MANDATORY: ALL IMAGES MUST BE SQUARE**

- **Aspect Ratio**: EXACTLY 1:1 (square)
- **Dimensions**: 1024x1024 pixels
- **NO portrait or landscape orientations**
- **Verify before generating** that the output will be perfectly square

### Character Design

#### Form & Shape
- **Silhouette**: Rounded, soft, bulbous forms with no sharp angles
- **Proportions**:
  - Large heads relative to bodies (approximately 1:2 or 1:1.5 ratio)
  - Stubby limbs with minimal joint articulation
  - Simplified anatomical features
  - Characters often appear rotund and cuddly
- **Construction**:
  - Built from simple geometric shapes (ovals, circles, rounded rectangles)
  - Minimal segmentation between body parts
  - Smooth, continuous contour lines

#### Line Work
- **Line Quality**:
  - Hand-drawn appearance with slight imperfections
  - Consistent medium-weight black outlines (approximately 2-4pt equivalent)
  - Lines are smooth but not perfectly uniform
  - Slightly variable line weight that suggests hand-drawing
- **Line Style**:
  - Clean, confident strokes
  - No sketchy or multiple overlapping lines
  - Closed forms with complete outlines
  - Minimal interior detail lines

#### Facial Features
- **Eyes**:
  - Simple dots or small circles
  - Often just black dots, sometimes with white highlights
  - Placement creates friendly, non-threatening expressions
  - Widely spaced for younger characters, closer for adults
- **Mouths**:
  - Simple curves or small shapes
  - Open mouths shown as simple black ovals or U-shapes
  - Minimal teeth detail (simple white rectangles if shown)
- **Noses**:
  - Often omitted or suggested with minimal detail
  - Small dots or tiny curved lines when present
- **Expression**:
  - Achieved through simple arrangement of features
  - Eyebrow position suggested by eye placement
  - Overall expression is gentle and approachable

#### Character Colors
- **Fill Technique**:
  - Flat or very subtly gradient fills within outlined shapes
  - Characters colored in solid pastel or muted tones
  - Light, delicate shading (if present) using slightly darker tones of base color
  - No dramatic shadows or highlights
- **Color Consistency**:
  - Each character maintains consistent coloring throughout the book
  - Animals may use naturalistic but pastel-ified colors (pink pigs, cream hippos, yellow-green creatures)

### Background Design

#### Color Palette
- **Primary Characteristic**: Bold, saturated pastel backgrounds
- **Color Categories**:
  - **Warm Pastels**: Coral pink, peach, soft orange, warm yellow, golden mustard
  - **Cool Pastels**: Sky blue, teal, sage green, lavender, soft purple
  - **Neutral Pastels**: Cream, soft gray-blue, warm gray, beige
  - **Deeper Tones**: Navy blue, rust orange, olive green (for contrast)
- **Color Intensity**: Colors are vibrant yet soft - not neon, not washed out
- **Hex Range Examples**:
  - Coral Pink: #F4A4A4 to #FF9999
  - Peach: #FFBD9A to #FFB088
  - Sky Blue: #87CEEB to #7EC8E3
  - Sage Green: #9DC183 to #8FBC8F
  - Mustard Yellow: #FFD966 to #FFCC5C
  - Lavender Gray: #B8A9C9 to #C8B8D0

#### Background Treatment
- **Texture**:
  - Solid color fills that appear flat or with very subtle texture
  - May include slight paper texture or watercolor-like subtle variations
  - No gradients unless very gentle (e.g., sunset sky)
- **Complexity**:
  - Extremely minimal background detail
  - Backgrounds are mostly solid color fields
  - Environmental elements are simplified to essential shapes
- **Environmental Elements**:
  - When present, kept very simple (e.g., simple waves, basic hills, minimal furniture)
  - Drawn in the same outlined, flat-color style as characters
  - Often white or light-colored simple shapes against the pastel background

### Composition & Layout

#### Text Placement
- **Integration**: Text is overlaid directly on the colored background
- **Text Color**:
  - **Primary**: Black text (most common)
  - **Alternative**: White text (when background is dark, like navy blue)
  - **Emphasis**: Occasionally both black AND white text on the same page for visual variety or emphasis
  - **Mixed Case**: Some words in ALL CAPS for emphasis, others in regular case
- **Text Size Variation**:
  - Key words or emphasized concepts in LARGER type
  - Supporting text in smaller, more delicate type
  - Size variation creates visual rhythm and hierarchy
- **Typography**:
  - Sans-serif fonts with friendly, rounded characteristics
  - Hand-lettered appearance (though consistent)
  - Clear, legible letterforms suitable for early readers
  - Letters may have slightly irregular baselines suggesting hand-drawing

#### Spatial Organization
- **White Space**: Generous use of empty background space
- **Character Placement**:
  - Characters occupy approximately 30-60% of page area
  - Often positioned off-center for dynamic composition
  - Characters may bleed slightly off page edges
  - Multiple characters arranged with clear spacing between them
- **Text Positioning**:
  - Text placed in areas of solid background color
  - Positioned to avoid overlapping important character details
  - May be top, bottom, side, or center - varies per page
  - Sometimes text wraps around characters

#### Visual Balance
- **Symmetry**: Generally asymmetric compositions
- **Weight Distribution**: Characters and text balanced across spread
- **Eye Flow**: Compositions guide the eye naturally left-to-right and through the spread
- **Focal Points**: Clear primary focal point (usually main character or action)

### Color Relationships

#### Spread Color Consistency
- **Same Scene = Same Background**: All pages within a single scene/spread share identical background color
- **Scene Transitions**: Background color changes mark new scenes or moments
- **Color Sequencing**: Colors often alternate or vary between spreads to maintain visual interest

#### Contrast Principles
- **Character-Background Contrast**: Characters must stand out clearly from background
  - Light characters on medium-to-dark backgrounds
  - Medium-toned characters on light or dark backgrounds
- **Text Contrast**:
  - Black text requires lighter backgrounds (pastels, light colors)
  - White text requires darker backgrounds (navy, deep colors)
- **Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast for young eyes to distinguish all elements
